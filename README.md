# TrueRandomPasswordGenerator

Tired of Pseudorandom generation? Sick of pretending your passwords are safe from quantum aliens?

You need the True Random Password Generator. Just day 2 of my journey following a Python programming course and I've already figured it out.

This program scrapes Wikipedia for the name of the current UK Prime Minister and uses it as an unpredictable, unknowable, ever-changing seed for Python's built in randomization. Completely uncrackable passwords in mere seconds assuming I did it right.
